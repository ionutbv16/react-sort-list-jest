# Revenue aggregator application

You are creating an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of a revenue aggregator application. It's a React-based web application which displays a list of products of a store in a table that is sorted, filterable and displays total revenue in the filtered list.


## Setup

Follow these steps to setup the app:

1. `npm install` – install dependencies
2. `npm test` – run all tests in watch mode (should fail unless you implement the app)
3. `npm start` – serve the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (it automatically opens the app in your default browser)
